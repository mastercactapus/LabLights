=========
This is the source code for the controller for my lights at my desk :)



TODO
----------
* change to timer1 for power level
* use 16 bit integers (lets go with asthetics :D ) for power levels
* remove fade time and calculations, have a single configurable rate/delay for fading
* use timer0 interrupts for fading power levels
* test power usage above 1Mhz
